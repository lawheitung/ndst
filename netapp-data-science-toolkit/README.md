NetApp Data Science Toolkit
=========

The NetApp Data Science Toolkit is a Python library that makes it simple for data scientists and data engineers to perform various data management tasks, such as near-instantaneously provisioning a new data volume or JupyterLab workspace, near-instantaneously cloning a data volume or JupyterLab workspace, and near-instantaneously snapshotting a data volume or JupyterLab workspace for traceability/baselining. This Python library can function as either a command line utility or a library of functions that can be imported into any Python program or Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

The NetApp Data Science Toolkit comes in two different flavors - one for Kubernetes-based environments, and one for traditional VM-based or bare-metal environments. Choose the appropriate flavor to use based on your specific environment and use case.

- [NetApp Data Science Toolkit for Kubernetes](Kubernetes/)
- [NetApp Data Science Toolkit for Traditional Environments](Traditional/)
